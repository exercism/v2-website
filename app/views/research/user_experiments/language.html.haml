          %p In part 1 you will be solving a short programming problem in #{@language_track.title}. We are interested in how your programming background and experience affects how you choose to shape your code. There is no right or wrong solution - just lots of tradeoffs, so do what feels good to you.

          .status.in-progress In progress

          %p In part 2 you will be adding functionality to an existing program. You will be building on someone else's solution to Part 1. We are interested in seeing what approach you take to expanding and refactoring their code. Again, there's no right or wrong.
