## Development setup

This is a Ruby on Rails (5.2) application backed by MySQL. There are two ways to run it locally:
1) Setup a local development environment with the steps below.
2) Use a pre-made Docker setup. We don't maintain an official Docker repo, but you can try [this version](https://github.com/unused/exercism-docker) kindly maintained by [@unused](https://github.com/unused).

### Things to install

- **Ruby**: We recommend Ruby >=2.4 (and this will soon become a requirement). We recommend using [RVM](http://rvm.io/)
- **MySQL**: MySQL >=5.7 required. Install via your system's package manager or follow the official [Installation instructions](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)
- **Yarn**: Yarn handles front-end dependencies. See Yarn's [installation instructions](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install).
- **Redis**: Redis >=2.8 required. Sidekiq uses Redis to store all of its job and operational data. [Installation instructions](https://redis.io/topics/quickstart) or checkout your OS's package manager.

### Configure the database

Something like this will then get a working database setup:

```bash
mysql -e "CREATE USER 'exercism_reboot'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'exercism_reboot'" -u root -p
mysql -e "create database exercism_reboot_development" -u root -p
mysql -e "create database exercism_reboot_test" -u root -p
mysql -e "ALTER DATABASE exercism_reboot_development CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;" -u root -p
mysql -e "ALTER DATABASE exercism_reboot_test CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;" -u root -p
mysql -e "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON exercism_reboot_development.* TO 'exercism_reboot'@'localhost'" -u root -p
mysql -e "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON exercism_reboot_test.* TO 'exercism_reboot'@'localhost'" -u root -p
```

### Install Bundler

Bundle is used to handle the project's Ruby dependencies. You can install it via
```bash
gem install bundler
```

### Initial setup

Firstly, you need to set a server identity, which you can do like this:

```bash
echo "host" > server_identity
```

Then we've put a rake task together that should set everything else up. You can run it like this:

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec rake exercism:setup
```

### Running a webserver

To run a webserver, simple run:
```bash
bundle exec rails s
```

Something like this will get a working webserver on http://lvh.me:3000
Note: Teams will be available on http://teams.lvh.me:3000

### Notes

We recommend using `lvh.me` which is a DNS redirect to localhost, but which we honour cookies on.

### OAuth setup

In order to login via OAuth on development, [create a new OAuth application on GitHub](https://github.com/settings/applications/new).

Fill in the form with the following details:

- Application Name: Exercism (Dev)
- Homepage URL: https://lvh.me:3000
- Authorization Callback URL: http://lvh.me:3000/users/auth/github/callback

The hostname and port would depend on your development setup.

Once created, paste in the GitHub key and secret into `config/secrets.yml`.

## Extra scripts and useful notes

### Deleting an account

 To delete a user, run `user.destroy.`

The user record is deleted, as well as associated objects except the ff:

- Discussion posts where they are a mentor.
- Maintainer records where their user record is associated.

## Troubleshooting
### MySQL < 5.7
The following error is seen using MySQL prior to version 5.7 as discussed at [gogs/gogs#4894](https://github.com/gogs/gogs/issues/4894).
```
$ bundle exec rake exercism:setup
Mysql2::Error: Specified key was too long; max key length is 767 bytes:
```
If your system doesn't have a pre-built 5.7 package, [this install log](https://github.com/exercism/pharo/issues/103#issuecomment-420769061) may be helpful.

### Windows Subsystem For Linux
Installation on Windows Subsystem For Linux requires Windows Version 1809 (release due October 2018).
Tracked at [exercism/exercism#4346](https://github.com/exercism/exercism/issues/4346).
